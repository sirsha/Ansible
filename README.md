# Ansible Configuration for Pre-Provisioned Resources

This repository contains Ansible playbooks for configuring pre-provisioned resources such as EC2 instances. Follow the instructions below to set up and configure your resources successfully.
## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed and configured:
1. **Ansible**: Ensure that Ansible is installed on your local machine. You can install Ansible by following the instructions in the [official Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/index.html).
2. **AWS CLI**: If you're using AWS EC2 instances, make sure the AWS CLI is installed and configured with the necessary credentials. Follow the [AWS CLI documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) for installation instructions.
3. **Changes to Ansible Configuration**: You might need to adjust the Ansible configuration (`ansible.cfg`) to specify settings such as the inventory file location, remote user, etc., depending on your environment.
4. **Dynamic Inventory Setup**: If you're using EC2 instances and want to use dynamic inventory, ensure that your AWS credentials are correctly configured and that your EC2 instances are tagged appropriately for inclusion in the dynamic inventory. Refer to the [Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_dynamic_inventory.html#) for details on setting up dynamic inventory.
